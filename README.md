## [Binary Search](https://github.com/ksdevinney/musical-train/blob/main/binary-search.js)

Search method that allows you to quickly search for an element in an array. By dividing the array in half, you can search much more efficiently than by checking every element in order. First, you find the middle of the array. Next, you determine if the value you are searching for is greater or less than the midpoint. The search continues on the other half of the array; you eliminate roughly half of the values each time until the value is found (or not). If the value is in the array, this function will return the index of the value.

## Selection Sort

This sorting algorithm orders an array of numbers by traversing through and swapping values. The first traversal through the array, we will find the smallest value and swap it with the first element. On the next traversal, we will again look for the smallest value and swap it with the second element. This continues until the array is sorted.
